# Minimal API Playground

This project is a playground for the minimal API while attempting to satisfy my standard practices of development.

## Practices

- [x] Open API generation with Swagger UI.
- [x] Health checks.
  - [ ] Readiness and liveness status indication. This is implemented well but readiness and liveness is does not have distinct pages.
- [x] API tags which behave like traditional ASP.NET controllers behave.
- [x] Use validation
- [x] Use mediator.
- [x] Unit Tests
- [x] Integration Tests
